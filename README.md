#About BlankSlate
__Why?__ Good question. I got fed up of trying to roll resets into my [http://lesscss.org/](less) files during the build phase of my projects so I decided once and for all to convert them to the less format and put them up here in case other people wanted them too.
They're probably compatible with other CSS pre-compilers but I haven't tested so if they're not by all means fork this repository, convert them and make a pull request.
I claim no ownership over the techniques used in these files, I'm just converting them to a different format for a particular use case and I hope that others find them useful too. Please use them liberally, without regret and with utter abandon. Drive carefully. Phone your mother.
